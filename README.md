# This project requires one addition after it is cloned

The first step is create a new file in the root directory named token.js, and include the following code snippet

    exports.token = '****THE TOKEN WILL BE PLACED HERE****';

The token will need to be retreived from the owner of the bot. This can be found at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
